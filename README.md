# Churn

Customer (or employee) churn, or attrition, at its simplest, can be calculated by choosing a time period, then dividing the number of customers lost
during that period by the total number of customers at the beginning of the period.

Various statistics and machine learning techniques can enhance the measure of churn, helping identify the variables leading to attrition and
grouping customers by cluster based on their attrition risk.
